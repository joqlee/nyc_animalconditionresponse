# NYC Urban Park Ranger Animal Condition Response

**Tools: Python, Tableau**

This project aims to analyze the characteristics of animal assistance, relocation, or rescue requests made to the New York City Urban Park Rangers. The dataset comes from NYC OpenData and consists of requests that were completed by the Urban Park Rangers between 2018 and 2021.

I used Python in Jupyter Notebook to clean, analyze, and visualize the data. I also created an interactive dashboard visualization using Tableau that summarizes the total calls made and number of species responded to overall, or in a particular borough. The dashboard is fully interactive; all the data can be filtered by clicking on a bar, segment of the pie chart, or square on a heat map. By combining filters, one can easily answer specific questions such as "what species was most often the subject of calls in Brooklyn in November 2018?"
