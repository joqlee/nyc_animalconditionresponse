This makes sense considering that raccoons are both ubiquitous and potentially dangerous if afflicted with canine distemper, which makes it necessary to alert professionals to humanely euthanize the raccoon. The next most frequently involved species is the Canada Goose, followed by the Red-Tailed Hawk."

    "Animal assistance responses seem to go up slightly in the middle of the week. It seems unlikely that this is due to animals being more likely to be injured, die, etc. on Wednesday and Thursdays. Perhaps this might be related to different levels of park attendance on certain days of the week, since parks are where many of the requests are called to. Higher levels of park attendance on a certain day might lead to more requests for animal assistance. It might be interesting to procure data on park attendance and examine this hypothesis further. "
